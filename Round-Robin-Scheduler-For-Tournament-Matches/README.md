# Round-Robin-Scheduler-For-Tournament-Matches
A Maven based java project, which aims to schedule matches depending on the number of Teams playing the tournament and the number of Venues. The matches are scheduled in Round-Robin format. The scheduler is provided a tournament beginning date. If there are multiple rounds of round-robin, then matches are scheduled accordingly. The project is built entirely on OOP concepts. The scheduler makes sure that no two matches are being played on the same venue on the same date. If there are no venues available on a particular day, then no further matches are scheduled on that day. The project is inspired from real life Cricket-Football tournaments. Points against each team is also maintained and it is possible to find the winner of the tournament as well. JUnit Test cases are also written for each of the Java classes of the project.
